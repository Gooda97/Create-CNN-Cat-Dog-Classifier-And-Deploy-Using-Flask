# Depoly-Cat-Dog-Classifier-Using-Flask
### Training the model
- In this repository I have trained a CNN model using a dataset from kaggle which can be downloaded from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats).
- The training code can be found [Here](/Training/).

### Deploying the model 
- I have used Flask server to deploy this model using two routes, one for taking the data from the user and the other is to show the results.
- The GUI of the input page is as shown:

- The GUI of the output prediction page is as shown:

### Requirements
- The requirements to run the server is listed in [This file](/requirements.txt).
